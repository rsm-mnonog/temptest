    "text": "UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING\n\nüü¶ Introduction to K-Means Clustering\nClustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique used to identify natural groupings within data. In this section, we explore the K-Means algorithm ‚Äî a widely used partitioning method that aims to minimize the within-cluster variance by iteratively updating centroids. To deepen our understanding, we implement the algorithm from scratch and visualize each iterative step to observe how centroids converge. We apply our custom K-Means implementation to the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing specifically on the bill_length_mm and flipper_length_mm features. Finally, we compare our results to the built-in KMeans function from Python‚Äôs scikit-learn library to evaluate accuracy and consistency. \n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Load and clean the dataset\npenguins_df = pd.read_csv('other_docs/palmer_penguins.csv')\ndata = penguins_df[['bill_length_mm', 'flipper_length_mm']].dropna().values\n\n# Custom K-means implementation\ndef kmeans_custom(data, k=3, max_iters=100):\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    centroids = data[np.random.choice(len(data), k, replace=False)]\n    history = [centroids.copy()]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iters):\n        distances = np.linalg.norm(data[:, np.newaxis] - centroids, axis=2)\n        clusters = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)\n        new_centroids = np.array([data[clusters == i].mean(axis=0) for i in range(k)])\n        history.append(new_centroids.copy())\n        if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):\n            break\n        centroids = new_centroids\n\n    return centroids, clusters, history\n\n# Run custom K-means\ncentroids_final, cluster_labels, history = kmeans_custom(data, k=3)\n\n# Plot steps of custom K-means\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(len(history), 1, figsize=(6, len(history) * 4))\nfor i, centroids in enumerate(history):\n    axs[i].scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c='gray', s=30, alpha=0.5)\n    axs[i].scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', marker='X', s=100)\n    axs[i].set_title(f'Step {i}')\n    axs[i].set_xlabel('Bill Length (mm)')\n    axs[i].set_ylabel('Flipper Length (mm)')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n# Built-in KMeans\nkmeans_builtin = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)\nbuiltin_labels = kmeans_builtin.fit_predict(data)\n\n# Plot comparison of custom vs built-in\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))\n\n# Custom K-means\naxs[0].scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=cluster_labels, cmap='viridis', s=30)\naxs[0].scatter(centroids_final[:, 0], centroids_final[:, 1], c='red', marker='X', s=100)\naxs[0].set_title('Custom K-Means')\naxs[0].set_xlabel('Bill Length (mm)')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('Flipper Length (mm)')\n\n# Built-in K-means\naxs[1].scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=builtin_labels, cmap='viridis', s=30)\naxs[1].scatter(kmeans_builtin.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans_builtin.cluster_centers_[:, 1], c='red', marker='X', s=100)\naxs[1].set_title('Built-in KMeans (sklearn)')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('Bill Length (mm)')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('Flipper Length (mm)')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Interpretation of K-Means Clustering Visuals\nüîÑ K-Means Convergence Process (Step-by-Step GIF-like Sequence) ‚Ä¢ Description: The tall vertical figure shows the movement of centroids (red X‚Äôs) over a series of steps (Step 0 to Step 10) during your custom K-Means algorithm. ‚Ä¢ Initial State (Step 0): The centroids are randomly initialized and poorly positioned relative to the data clusters. ‚Ä¢ Early Iterations (Steps 1‚Äì4): You can see the centroids move quickly toward the center of dense data regions. This indicates the algorithm is beginning to form tighter clusters. ‚Ä¢ Later Iterations (Steps 5‚Äì10): The centroid movement gradually slows down and stabilizes. At this point, data point assignments no longer change significantly, indicating convergence. ‚Ä¢ Final State (Step 10): All centroids have settled at positions that represent the center of their respective clusters. The cluster structure is clearly aligned with the natural groupings in the data.\n‚úÖ This sequence demonstrates successful implementation and convergence of your custom K-Means algorithm.\n‚∏ª\n‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: Custom vs.¬†Built-in KMeans (Side-by-Side Plot) ‚Ä¢ Left Plot (Custom K-Means): Each data point is colored by its final cluster assignment, and the centroids are clearly located in the densest areas of their respective clusters. ‚Ä¢ Right Plot (scikit-learn Built-in): The result is nearly identical to your custom implementation ‚Äî clusters are almost perfectly aligned and centroids occupy similar positions.\nKey Observations: ‚Ä¢ Both methods captured three natural clusters, consistent with the known species structure in the Palmer Penguins dataset. ‚Ä¢ Cluster separation is clean, especially along the flipper length dimension. ‚Ä¢ Your custom implementation is highly consistent with the built-in version, validating its correctness.\n‚∏ª\n‚úÖ Summary ‚Ä¢ Your custom K-Means algorithm not only converged properly but also matched the performance and output of the built-in KMeans from scikit-learn. ‚Ä¢ The step-by-step visualization helps demystify the iterative process of centroid updates, offering valuable pedagogical insight. ‚Ä¢ The comparison confirms that feature selection (bill length and flipper length) is appropriate for uncovering species-level clusters in the penguin dataset.\n\n\nApropriate Number of Cluster K\nAfter implementing and testing the K-Means algorithm, the next step is to determine the most appropriate number of clusters (k) for the data. Two commonly used metrics for evaluating cluster quality are the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and the silhouette score. WCSS measures the compactness of clusters ‚Äî lower values indicate tighter groupings ‚Äî while the silhouette score assesses how well-separated the clusters are, balancing cohesion and separation. In this section, we compute both metrics across a range of cluster counts (k = 2 to 7) using the Palmer Penguins dataset. The goal is to identify the ‚Äúelbow‚Äù point in the WCSS plot and the peak silhouette value, which together guide us in selecting the optimal number of clusters that best represent the underlying structure in the data.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n\n# Load and clean the dataset\npenguins_df = pd.read_csv('other_docs/palmer_penguins.csv')\ndata = penguins_df[['bill_length_mm', 'flipper_length_mm']].dropna().values\n\n# Prepare lists to store metrics\nwcss = []  # Within-cluster sum of squares\nsilhouette_scores = []\n\n# Try different numbers of clusters\nK_values = range(2, 8)\n\nfor k in K_values:\n    model = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)\n    labels = model.fit_predict(data)\n    \n    # Append metrics\n    wcss.append(model.inertia_)  # WCSS is inertia\n    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(data, labels))\n\n# Plot WCSS and Silhouette Scores\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))\n\n# WCSS plot\naxs[0].plot(K_values, wcss, marker='o')\naxs[0].set_title('Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)')\naxs[0].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('WCSS')\n\n# Silhouette Score plot\naxs[1].plot(K_values, silhouette_scores, marker='o')\naxs[1].set_title('Silhouette Scores')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('Silhouette Score')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìä Interpretation of Cluster Evaluation Metrics\nüîπ Left Plot: Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) ‚Ä¢ What it shows: WCSS measures the total variance within each cluster. As k increases, WCSS naturally decreases because points are grouped into more localized clusters. ‚Ä¢ Elbow Method: There is a visible ‚Äúelbow‚Äù at k = 3 ‚Äî this is the point where the rate of WCSS reduction slows noticeably. This suggests that using 3 clusters captures most of the structure in the data without overfitting. ‚Ä¢ Interpretation: The elbow at k = 3 is a strong indicator that three clusters represent a good balance between model simplicity and explanatory power.\n‚∏ª\nüîπ Right Plot: Silhouette Scores ‚Ä¢ What it shows: The silhouette score evaluates how well each point fits within its cluster versus other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1; higher values indicate better-defined, well-separated clusters. ‚Ä¢ Peak Value: The highest silhouette score occurs at k = 2, indicating tight and well-separated clusters in that configuration. ‚Ä¢ Score Behavior: The silhouette score drops significantly after k = 2, and continues to decline gradually. At k = 3, it remains reasonably high but lower than at k = 2. ‚Ä¢ Interpretation: While k = 2 yields the best-defined clusters, it may underrepresent the true complexity of the dataset. k = 3 offers a compromise ‚Äî it aligns with the elbow method and is still supported by a relatively high silhouette score.\n‚∏ª\n‚úÖ Conclusion ‚Ä¢ Recommended number of clusters: k = 3 is the optimal choice when balancing both the WCSS (elbow method) and silhouette score. ‚Ä¢ Rationale: While k = 2 shows the best silhouette, the additional cluster in k = 3 likely reflects meaningful substructure (e.g., the three penguin species), especially when combined with domain knowledge.\n\n\n\nüåÄ Visualizing K-Means with Animation\nTo enhance interpretability and demonstrate how the K-Means algorithm converges, we create an animated visualization of the clustering process. This animation illustrates how centroids shift over iterations and how data points are reassigned until the algorithm stabilizes. By saving each iteration as an image and compiling them into a GIF, we can clearly observe the step-by-step progression of centroid movement and cluster formation. This dynamic approach offers an intuitive understanding of how K-Means operates, especially in contrast to static plots, and aligns with the spirit of interactive data storytelling.\n\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport imageio.v2 as imageio  # Use v2 to avoid deprecation warnings\n\n# Load and clean the dataset\npenguins_df = pd.read_csv('other_docs/palmer_penguins.csv')\ndata = penguins_df[['bill_length_mm', 'flipper_length_mm']].dropna().values\n\n# Custom K-means implementation\ndef kmeans_custom(data, k=3, max_iters=10):  # Keep max_iters small for animation\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    centroids = data[np.random.choice(len(data), k, replace=False)]\n    history = [centroids.copy()]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iters):\n        distances = np.linalg.norm(data[:, np.newaxis] - centroids, axis=2)\n        clusters = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)\n        new_centroids = np.array([data[clusters == i].mean(axis=0) for i in range(k)])\n        history.append(new_centroids.copy())\n        if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):\n            break\n        centroids = new_centroids\n\n    return clusters, history\n\n# Run K-means\nclusters, history = kmeans_custom(data, k=3)\n\n# Create folder for frames\nframe_dir = \"kmeans_frames\"\nos.makedirs(frame_dir, exist_ok=True)\nfilenames = []\n\n# Save each step as an image\nfor i, centroids in enumerate(history):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4), dpi=80)\n    plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c='gray', alpha=0.5)\n    plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', marker='X', s=100)\n    plt.title(f\"K-Means Step {i}\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Bill Length (mm)\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n    fname = f\"{frame_dir}/frame_{i:02d}.png\"\n    plt.savefig(fname, bbox_inches='tight')\n    filenames.append(fname)\n    plt.close()\n\n# Create animated GIF\ngif_path = \"kmeans_animation.gif\"\nwith imageio.get_writer(gif_path, mode='I', duration=0.8) as writer:\n    for filename in filenames:\n        image = imageio.imread(filename)\n        writer.append_data(image)\n# import imageio\n# images = []\n# for filename in filenames:\n#     images.append(imageio.imread(filename))\n# imageio.mimsave('kmeans_animation.gif', images)\n\nprint(f\"GIF saved to {gif_path}\")\n\nGIF saved to kmeans_animation.gif"

This gave me a well-rounded view of each variable‚Äôs influence from both statistical and machine learning perspectives.\n‚∏ª\nüìà 1. Pearson Correlation\nI found that trust, impact, and service had the strongest direct linear relationships with satisfaction, each with correlations above 25%. This tells me that customers who rated these attributes higher also reported higher satisfaction.\n‚∏ª\n‚öôÔ∏è 2. Standardized Coefficients\nLooking at the standardized coefficients from the regression model, impact stood out the most (15.0%), followed by trust (13.6%) and service (10.4%). On the other hand, features like rewarding and build had very little influence once I controlled for other variables.\n‚∏ª\nüß™ 3. Permutation Importance\nUsing permutation importance, which measures the model‚Äôs drop in performance when features are shuffled, I again saw that trust, impact, and service were the most useful predictors. This aligns with what I saw in the correlation and regression results.\n‚∏ª\nüß† 4. Shapley Values (LMG Approximation)\nShapley value approximations confirmed the same pattern: trust and impact had the highest contributions to model R¬≤, while build and popular contributed very little.\n‚∏ª\nüìä 5. Johnson‚Äôs Relative Weights\nThis method really highlighted how dominant impact is ‚Äî it accounted for over 40% of the total explained variance. Trust (33%) and service (19%) followed. Features like rewarding and popular had near-zero weights, suggesting they don‚Äôt uniquely contribute much once everything else is accounted for.\n‚∏ª\nüå≥ 6. Random Forest Gini Importance\nWith Random Forest, I saw that trust, impact, and service were again top-ranked in terms of splitting power, confirming their importance in both linear and nonlinear models.\n‚∏ª\n‚úÖ Summary\nAcross all the methods I used, three features consistently emerged as the most important drivers of satisfaction: 1. Impact ‚Äì especially dominant in Johnson‚Äôs weights and regression. 2. Trust ‚Äì strong across all methods. 3. Service ‚Äì a reliable contributor in both linear and machine learning models.\nFeatures like rewarding, build, and popular showed some association but had relatively minor unique contributions.\nThis analysis helped me identify not just what correlates with satisfaction, but which drivers have the strongest and most consistent predictive power across various modeling techniques.\n\n\nüß† Advanced Model-Based Importance Measures (Challenge)\nTo deepen the analysis and explore the consistency of feature importance across modeling techniques, we extend the key drivers table with metrics from more advanced machine learning models. Specifically, we include permutation-based importance from a neural network and attempt to incorporate feature importance from XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting framework. These models are capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships that traditional regression may overlook. By comparing these modern importance metrics with earlier measures such as standardized coefficients and Gini importance, we can assess the robustness of our findings and uncover deeper insights into what truly drives customer satisfaction.

These included traditional statistical measures like Pearson correlation and standardized regression coefficients, as well as machine learning-based methods like permutation importance, Shapley value approximations (LMG), Johnson‚Äôs relative weights, Random Forest Gini importance, and Neural Net permutation scores. Here‚Äôs how I interpreted the results:\n‚∏ª\nüîπ 1. Pearson Correlation (%)\nThese values tell me how strongly each feature correlates with satisfaction on its own. I saw that: ‚Ä¢ Trust (25.6%), Impact (25.5%), and Service (25.1%) had the strongest linear relationships with satisfaction. ‚Ä¢ These three features are likely good standalone predictors.\n‚∏ª\n‚öôÔ∏è 2. Standardized Coefficients (%)\nThese reflect the effect of each feature in a multivariate linear regression model. Here: ‚Ä¢ Impact (15.0%) and Trust (13.6%) came out as top contributors, even after accounting for the presence of other features. ‚Ä¢ Service (10.4%) was also notably important. ‚Ä¢ Other variables like Rewarding, Popular, and Build had very low coefficients, which tells me they contribute relatively little when other variables are considered.\n‚∏ª\nüîÑ 3. Permutation Importance (%)\nThis model-agnostic approach shows how much predictive performance drops when a feature is randomly shuffled. ‚Ä¢ Again, Trust, Impact, and Service rank highest, reinforcing their central role. ‚Ä¢ Mid-tier features like Easy, Appealing, and Popular are still somewhat useful, but not dominant.\n‚∏ª\nüß† 4. LMG / Shapley Approximation (%)\nLMG values estimate how much each variable contributes to explaining satisfaction, averaged across all possible feature orderings. ‚Ä¢ Impact (2.4%) and Trust (2.0%) had the largest shares of explanatory power. ‚Ä¢ Service (1.6%) remained consistently important. ‚Ä¢ Features like Popular and Differs had very low Shapley contributions, suggesting they don‚Äôt add much unique value.\n‚∏ª\nüìä 5. Johnson‚Äôs Relative Weights (%)\nThis method decomposes explained variance using PCA to isolate how much each variable contributes independently. ‚Ä¢ Impact (40.4%) and Trust (32.8%) absolutely dominated here. ‚Ä¢ Service (19.1%) also had significant weight. ‚Ä¢ Other features, especially Rewarding, Popular, and Build, had minimal impact‚Äîless than 3%.\n‚∏ª\nüå≥ 6. Random Forest Gini (%)\nThis measures how important each variable is for tree-based splits in the Random Forest model. ‚Ä¢ Again, Trust (15.6%), Impact (14.1%), and Service (13.0%) stood out. ‚Ä¢ Gini values were more evenly distributed across remaining features, but still consistent with the pattern.\n‚∏ª\nü§ñ 7. Neural Net Permutation Importance (%)\nThis measures how much performance drops when features are shuffled in a trained neural network. ‚Ä¢ Service (6.9%), Impact (6.3%), and Trust (6.3%) were the top features. ‚Ä¢ Even here, nonlinear modeling confirms the dominance of the same three drivers.\n‚∏ª\n‚úÖ Final Summary\nAcross all seven methods, three features consistently emerged as the most important: 1. Impact ‚Äì Highest in regression, Johnson‚Äôs weights, and Shapley value. 2. Trust ‚Äì High across every metric. 3. Service ‚Äì Always near the top, including in neural networks and random forests.\nOther features like Build, Rewarding, and Popular showed only minor influence. This analysis gives me strong confidence that Impact, Trust, and Service should be the key focus areas for improving customer satisfaction."

    "text": "üß† Interpretation: Region Breakdown by Customer Status\nThe stacked bar chart reveals clear regional patterns in customer status. The Northeast stands out with the largest customer base, where customers even outnumber non-customers ‚Äî a unique trend not seen in other regions. In contrast, all other regions, especially the Midwest and Southwest, have a significantly higher number of non-customers, suggesting that customer engagement is regionally concentrated and strongest in the Northeast.\n\n\nEstimation of Simple Poisson Model\nSince our outcome variable of interest can only be small integer values per a set unit of time, we can use a Poisson density to model the number of patents awarded to each engineering firm over the last 5 years. We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\n\n\n\nüß† Likelihood Function for Poisson\nFor a Poisson-distributed variable ( Y () ), the likelihood function is:\n[ (| Y) = _{i=1}^n ]\nTaking the log gives us the log-likelihood:\n[ (| Y) = _{i=1}^n ( -+ Y_i () - (Y_i!) ) ]\n\n\n\nüßÆ Code: Poisson Log-Likelihood Function\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln  # use this instead of factorial in log\n\n# Observed data\nY = blueprinty['patents'].dropna().astype(int).values\n\n# Log-likelihood function\ndef poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):\n    if lambda_ &lt;= 0:\n        return -np.inf\n    return np.sum(-lambda_ + Y * np.log(lambda_) - gammaln(Y + 1))\n\n# Vectorized version for plotting\ndef poisson_loglikelihood_vec(lambda_, Y):\n    lambda_ = np.asarray(lambda_)\n    return np.array([\n        np.sum(-l + Y * np.log(l) - gammaln(Y + 1))\n        if l &gt; 0 else -np.inf for l in lambda_\n    ])\n\n\n\n\nüìä Plot: Log-Likelihood over Lambda\n\nlambda_vals = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 200)\nlog_liks = poisson_loglikelihood_vec(lambda_vals, Y)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.plot(lambda_vals, log_liks)\nplt.title('Poisson Log-Likelihood for Varying Œª')\nplt.xlabel('Œª')\nplt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Analytically Solving for MLE\nTaking the derivative of the log-likelihood and setting it to zero yields:\n[ = -n + = 0 _{} = {Y} ]\nThis makes intuitive sense, as the mean of a Poisson distribution is its only parameter.\n\n\n\nüîß Numerical Optimization\n\n# Negative log-likelihood for optimization\ndef neg_loglikelihood(lambda_):\n    return -poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_[0], Y)\n\n# Optimize\nresult = minimize(neg_loglikelihood, x0=[1.0], bounds=[(1e-5, None)])\nlambda_mle = result.x[0]\n\nprint(f\"MLE for lambda: {lambda_mle:.4f}\")\n\nMLE for lambda: 3.6847\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úÖ Conclusion\nWe estimated the Poisson parameter ( ) via maximum likelihood using both analytical and numerical approaches. As expected, the MLE aligns with the sample mean of the observed patent counts.\n\n\nEstimation of Poisson Regression Model\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty."

To interpret them in a more intuitive way, we exponentiate the coefficient to express the effect as a percentage change.\nFor example:\n\nHolding all other variables constant, a 1-point increase in the cleanliness review score is associated with an approximate 11.31% increase in the expected number of reviews.\n\nThis interpretation comes from:\n[ = ((0.1131) - 1) % ]\nYou can apply the same method to interpret other variables in the model.\n\n\n\nüß† Interpretation of Results\n\ndays: The longer a listing has been active on Airbnb, the more reviews it accumulates ‚Äî as expected.\nbedrooms: Listings with more bedrooms receive more reviews, likely reflecting larger or more attractive spaces.\nbathrooms: Unexpectedly, more bathrooms are associated with slightly fewer reviews. This may reflect a subset of high-end listings with lower turnover.\nprice: A small negative relationship with reviews suggests that higher-priced listings may be booked less frequently.\ninstant_bookable: If significant, this would indicate that convenience boosts bookings.\nroom_type: Dummy variables capture how listing type (e.g., Private Room, Shared Room) affects bookings relative to the base category (Entire home/apt).\n\n\n‚úÖ Note: Coefficients in Poisson regression are on a log scale. For interpretability, exponentiating them gives the multiplicative effect on the expected number of reviews.\n\n\n\n\nüìå Conclusion\nThis model helps us understand how listing attributes affect booking frequency. By identifying drivers of higher review counts (e.g., instant booking, number of bedrooms, lower price), hosts and platforms like Airbnb can make more data-informed decisions."

The researchers utilized a direct mail fundraising campaign, sending letters to over 50,000 prior donors from the organization‚Äôs database. Each recipient received a four-page fundraising letter that was identical in content, except for three randomized elements in the treatment group.\nThe individuals were divided into:\nControl Group: Received a standard donation request letter, with no mention of a matching grant. Treatment Group: Received a letter including a paragraph that announced a matching grant from a ‚Äúconcerned fellow member.‚Äù Within the treatment group, letters were further randomized across three dimensions:\nMatch Ratio: $1:$1 (every dollar donated is matched with $1) $2:$1 (every dollar is matched with $2) $3:$1 (every dollar is matched with $3) Maximum Match Amount: $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or left unstated Suggested Donation Amounts: Based on the recipient‚Äôs previous highest donation, the reply card listed either the same amount, 1.25√ó, or 1.5√ó that amount The match offer was framed both in the text of the letter and visually highlighted on the reply card included in the envelope.

The t-test helps us determine whether there‚Äôs a statistically significant difference in the average time since last donation between the two groups. Then, we use a simple linear regression (mrm2 ~ treatment) to estimate the same difference ‚Äî where the treatment variable acts as a binary indicator (1 for treatment group, 0 for control). We summarize both results in clean, readable tables to clearly report the group means, differences, and statistical significance of the treatment effect. This allows us to confirm whether the random assignment successfully balanced this pre-treatment variable, which is an important validation step in any randomized experiment.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\ndf = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')\n\n# --- Manual T-Test ---\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['mrm2']\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['mrm2']\n\nmean_diff = treated.mean() - control.mean()\nse_diff = np.sqrt((treated.var(ddof=1)/len(treated)) + (control.var(ddof=1)/len(control)))\nt_stat = mean_diff / se_diff\ndfree = len(treated) + len(control) - 2\np_val = 2 * (1 - stats.t.cdf(np.abs(t_stat), df=dfree))\n\n# Create a clean results table\nt_test_table = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Group': ['Treatment', 'Control', 'Difference'],\n    'Mean (mrm2)': [treated.mean(), control.mean(), mean_diff],\n    'Std.

In fact, the difference is so small it‚Äôs essentially zero ‚Äî people in both groups donated around 13 months ago, on average.\nThis is exactly what we expect and want before the experiment starts. It means the random assignment to treatment and control worked correctly ‚Äî the two groups were similar before any fundraising letters were sent."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\nLet us visualize the donation rates for the treatment and control groups. We calculate the proportion of people who donated (gave == 1) in each group, then create a bar plot comparing these rates side by side. Each bar shows the average donation rate for its group, and we add labels above the bars to display the exact percentages. This plot gives a quick and intuitive view of how the treatment ‚Äî receiving a matching donation offer ‚Äî affected the likelihood of giving. This visualization complements our statistical analysis and helps illustrate the extensive margin effect of the treatment (i.e., whether more people chose to donate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step, we‚Äôre comparing donation rates between the treatment and control groups using two statistical approaches: a t-test and a simple linear regression. First, we perform an independent t-test to check if there is a statistically significant difference in the proportion of people who donated (gave) between the two groups. We summarize the group means, standard errors, and their difference in a clean table. Next, we run a bivariate linear regression (gave ~ treatment) to estimate the effect of treatment assignment on donation behavior. The treatment variable serves as a binary indicator (1 for treatment, 0 for control), and the coefficient tells us how much more (or less) likely someone is to donate if they were in the treatment group. Together, these analyses help us quantify and assess the causal impact of the matching donation offer on donation participation (i.e., the extensive margin).\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# --- Step 1: Split groups ---\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\n\n# --- Step 2: T-Test ---\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(treated, control, equal_var=False)\n\n# --- Step 3: Create a clean summary table for T-Test ---\nt_test_table = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Group': ['Treatment', 'Control'],\n    'Mean (gave)': [treated.mean(), control.mean()],\n    'Standard Error': [\n        treated.std(ddof=1) / np.sqrt(len(treated)),\n        control.std(ddof=1) / np.sqrt(len(control))\n    ]\n})\n\n# Add difference row with np.nan for missing Std.

Even though the increase might seem small numerically, the effect is meaningful: simply mentioning a matching gift nudges more people into taking action.\nThis tells us that:\nSocial cues matter. When people know others are also giving (like a ‚Äúconcerned member‚Äù offering a match), it makes them feel part of something. Framing matters. The idea that their donation will ‚Äúgo further‚Äù encourages behavior change. Behavior is not purely rational ‚Äî a simple sentence in a letter changes what people do with their money. This is why Table 2A (Panel A) in the paper is so important ‚Äî it quantifies how a subtle psychological nudge leads to real-world donations.\nNow let us estimate a probit regression model to analyze the effect of the treatment on the likelihood of making a donation. The dependent variable is gave (a binary indicator for whether the individual donated), and the independent variable is treatment (1 if the person received the matching offer, 0 otherwise). Using a probit model allows us to model the probability of donating as a nonlinear function of the treatment assignment, assuming a standard normal distribution of the error term. This method is appropriate for binary outcome variables and provides a more statistically rigorous approach than a linear probability model.

All p-values are well above 0.05, which means that none of the differences between match ratios are statistically significant. In other words, there‚Äôs no evidence that higher match ratios (like 2:1 or 3:1) increased the likelihood of giving compared to a 1:1 match.\nNext, we‚Äôre analyzing whether the size of the match ratio (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1) affects the likelihood that someone donates ‚Äî but only among individuals who were in the treatment group (i.e., who received a match offer). We approach this in two ways: 1. Dummy variable regression: We create binary variables for each match ratio and run a regression using gave as the outcome and ratio2 and ratio3 as predictors, with ratio1 (1:1 match) serving as the baseline. This lets us interpret the coefficients as changes in donation probability relative to the 1:1 group. 2. Categorical variable regression: We use C(ratio) to treat the ratio variable as a categorical factor. This achieves the same comparison as above but allows statsmodels to handle dummy coding internally. Both models help us determine whether offering a more generous match (like 2:1 or 3:1) significantly increases the probability of donation compared to a standard 1:1 match. The resulting tables summarize the estimated effects, their statistical significance, and allow us to assess whether larger match ratios are more effective. -\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# 1.

We‚Äôll do this in two ways: first, by calculating the differences directly from the observed data, and second, by comparing the coefficients from our earlier regression models. This will help us assess whether offering more generous match ratios leads to meaningfully higher donation rates.

This helps us understand whether the matching offer influenced not just whether people gave, but how much they gave.

Its effect on the intensive margin ‚Äî how much people give ‚Äî appears small and uncertain.\n\nNext step: Focus only on individuals who actually made a donation (gave == 1) and re-run the previous analysis using this subset. This allows us to examine how much people donate conditional on giving.

However, the p-value is 0.561, indicating that this difference is not statistically significant. In short, we find no evidence that the treatment affected the amount donated among those who gave.\nWe learned that the matching grant offer did not change how much people gave, once they decided to donate. The main impact of the treatment was likely on getting people to donate in the first place (the extensive margin), not on how much they donated (the intensive margin). So the match was effective at increasing participation, but not effective at increasing donation size among participants.\nDoes the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation? Answer: No, the treatment coefficient in this regression does not have a valid causal interpretation. Because the regression is conditional on donating (i.e., only includes people for whom gave == 1). But treatment itself influences who ends up in this group ‚Äî meaning we‚Äôre analyzing a selected subgroup that may differ systematically between treatment and control.\nThis introduces selection bias, so the regression tells us about differences among donors, but not about the causal effect of treatment on donation size.\n\nThen: We‚Äôll create two histograms ‚Äî one for the treatment group and one for the control group ‚Äî showing the distribution of donation amounts only among individuals who made a donation. We‚Äôll also add a red vertical line to each plot to mark the average donation amount, allowing us to visually compare the giving behavior between the two groups."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic ‚Äúworks,‚Äù in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\nFirst: We‚Äôll simulate 10,000 individual outcomes from both the treatment and control groups using their actual donation probabilities. For each simulated pair, we‚Äôll compute the difference in giving behavior (1 or 0). By calculating the cumulative average of these 10,000 differences, we‚Äôll observe how the estimated treatment effect evolves with increasing sample size. The plot will start off noisy, but it should stabilize around the true effect (~0.004) as the number of simulations grows. We‚Äôll use this to visually demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and explain the result to the reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-At first (left side of the plot), the estimate is highly volatile ‚Äî bouncing around because it‚Äôs based on only a few observations. -As the number of simulations increases (moving right), the average stabilizes and converges to the true treatment effect. -This is a practical demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers: the more data we gather, the more reliable our estimate becomes.\nAs the number of simulations increases (moving right), the average stabilizes and converges to the true treatment effect. This is a practical demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers: the more data we gather, the more reliable our estimate becomes.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nNow We‚Äôll simulate sampling from the treatment and control groups at four different sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each sample size, we‚Äôll draw 50 (or more) observations from each group, calculate the average difference in donation rates, and repeat this process 1,000 times to generate a distribution of sample differences. Then, we‚Äôll plot a histogram of those 1,000 differences for each sample size. This series of histograms will help demonstrate how, as sample size increases, the distribution of sample averages becomes narrower and more centered around the true treatment effect ‚Äî a visual illustration of the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Sample Size = 50: The distribution is wide and erratic. The sample mean differences vary a lot ‚Äî some simulations overestimate the effect, others underestimate it. The shape is not very normal.\n-Sample Size = 200: The distribution begins to tighten. It‚Äôs more centered around the true effect, though still somewhat spread out.\n-Sample Size = 500: The distribution is clearly bell-shaped, centered around the estimated effect, with less variation.\n-Sample Size = 1000: The distribution is even tighter and smoother. Most estimates fall within a narrow range around the true effect of ~0.0045.\nOverall, this progression of histograms visually demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem in action. As the sample size increases, the variability of the sampling distribution decreases, and the distribution becomes more symmetric and concentrated around the true treatment effect. This shows that with larger samples, our estimates become more reliable and precise ‚Äî even when the underlying effect is small. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that sample size plays a critical role in detecting and confidently estimating treatment effects in experimental data."
