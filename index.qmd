I'm a data science professional  with 10 years of operational leadership experience in the U.S. Navy and have Master’s in Business Analytics/Data Science at UC San Diego. My work bridges real-world problem-solving with technical expertise in Python, SQL, and machine learning. I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights through predictive modeling, data visualization, and dashboard development.  From leading analytics-driven decisions in high-stakes environments to building uplift models, churn prediction pipelines, and interactive dashboards, I bring a structured, results-oriented approach to solving business problems. I’m passionate about using data to drive measurable impact, especially in fields like healthcare, operations, and marketing, and I thrive in collaborative environments where curiosity, adaptability, and continuous learning are valued.
