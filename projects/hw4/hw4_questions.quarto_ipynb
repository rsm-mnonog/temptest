In this section, we explore the K-Means algorithm ‚Äî a widely used partitioning method that aims to minimize the within-cluster variance by iteratively updating centroids. To deepen our understanding, we implement the algorithm from scratch and visualize each iterative step to observe how centroids converge. We apply our custom K-Means implementation to the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing specifically on the bill_length_mm and flipper_length_mm features. Finally, we compare our results to the built-in KMeans function from Python‚Äôs scikit-learn library to evaluate accuracy and consistency.\n",

Two commonly used metrics for evaluating cluster quality are the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and the silhouette score. WCSS measures the compactness of clusters ‚Äî lower values indicate tighter groupings ‚Äî while the silhouette score assesses how well-separated the clusters are, balancing cohesion and separation. In this section, we compute both metrics across a range of cluster counts (k = 2 to 7) using the Palmer Penguins dataset.

In this section, we replicate the driver importance analysis shown on Slide 75 of the lecture slides using the data_for_drivers_analysis.csv dataset. Our target variable is satisfaction, and we evaluate the importance of nine key drivers using a comprehensive suite of methods. These include Pearson correlations, standardized regression coefficients, usefulness scores via permutation importance, Shapley value approximations (LMG), Johnson‚Äôs relative weights (Œµ), and mean decrease in Gini from a random forest. Together, these diverse techniques offer a well-rounded view of variable influence, capturing both linear associations and non-linear predictive power. This analysis not only validates the theoretical concepts covered in class but also provides a practical benchmark for feature attribution in real-world modeling.\n",
